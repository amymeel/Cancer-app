The results have been published in <em>Nature</em>.</p>\n<p>The researchers sequenced the genetic code of tissue samples from 962 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer. The samples came from 11 countries with varying incidence of kidney cancer. Upon examination, the team found a mutational signature of unknown cause in more than 70% of cases from Japan but in fewer than 2% of cases from the other countries. They also found a signature of unknown cause that was widely present in all countries but was more common in countries with higher kidney cancer incidence rates.</p>\n<p>Most cases in Romania, Serbia, and Thailand exhibited mutational signatures that are likely to be caused by exposure to aristolochic acid compounds, a known nephrotoxin and carcinogen. However, this study suggests that the geographical extent and the proportion of the population affected by these mutations are far greater than previously anticipated, possibly affecting many millions of people.</p>\n<p>Tobacco smoking, obesity, and hypertension are also known risk factors for clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Previously identified signatures of tobacco smoking were found during the study, but no specific mutational signature was found to be associated with obesity or hypertension, suggesting that these risk factors cause cancer in ways that do not mutate the genome.</p>\n<p>The discovery of new mutational signatures, whether they are geographically widespread or relatively confined, requires action to identify their sources and to determine the extent of exposure, to provide a foundation for public health action.

The theme of the congress is \u201cEnhancing Occupational Health Research and Practices: Closing the Gaps!\u201d. IARC Director Dr Elisabete Weiderpass will deliver the keynote address, on the global cancer burden due to occupational exposures. Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, Head of the <em>IARC Monographs</em> programme, will give a presentation titled \u201c<em>IARC Monographs</em> Update: Opportunities and challenges in occupational epidemiology and exposure characterization\u201d.</p>\n<p>IARC is a world leader in occupational health research. Recent investigations by IARC in this area include studies on chrysotile miners and millers in the Russian Federation and a joint report with the World Health Organization on non-melanoma skin cancer attributable to occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation.</p>\n<p>The <em>IARC Monographs</em> programme frequently evaluates occupational and environmental agents, and much of the data used by <em>Monographs</em> Working Groups when evaluating agents come from occupational cohort studies.</p>\n<p>IARC recently hosted an Advisory Group to recommend which agents should be evaluated by the <em>IARC Monographs</em> during 2025\u20132029. Many of the agents that the Advisory Group recommended for evaluation with high or medium priority are agents that workers would be exposed to through their occupation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.icoh2024.ma/programme.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit the International Congress on Occupational Health 2024 website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(24)00208-0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the article \u201cAdvisory Group recommendations on priorities for the <em>IARC Monographs</em>\u201d</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djad262\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the article \u201cCancer mortality in chrysotile miners and millers, Russian Federation: main results (Asbest Chrysotile Cohort Study)\u201d</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2023.108226\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Read the article \u201cGlobal, regional and national burdens of non-melanoma skin cancer attributable to occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation for 183 countries, 2000\u20132019: a systematic analysis from the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease and Injury\u201d</a></p>"}]}]
